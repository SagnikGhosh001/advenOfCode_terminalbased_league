What is the purpose of a mini league system?

The idea is to compete and test your skills against people of a similar skill level. This provides an opportunity to have a healthy competition. Why are we choosing this? When the entire league is listed together, some people were getting demoralised at the rate that other people were operating at. If you instead limit your competition to _your_ level, then the chances of being demoralised drastically decrease.

If you feel that you don't want to compete, then that's fine. But don't do it because you think competition among friends is bad. If that is the case, stop playing cricket with each other. Stop playing sports with each other.

The idea is also not to _sit with friends_ If that is what you want, go to a park. Go up to the cafeteria. Sit with friends all you like. The idea is to learn. In order to do that, you need to be among those that aren't like yourself but are at your level. 

In the end, this is all your decision. Frankly, all we are trying to do is to motivate and inspire. If the suggestions don't do either then do what you like.
